Here are some of the major concepts:

    An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
    if / else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
    We can add more conditions using else if statements.
    Relational operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != can compare two values.
    A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
